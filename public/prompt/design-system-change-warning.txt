⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: DESIGN SYSTEM HAS CHANGED ⚠️⚠️⚠️

The design was previously using a different design system.
You MUST NOW completely redesign everything to use the NEW design system.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- IGNORE all previous styling from the old design system
- CONVERT EVERYTHING to the new design system
- Change ALL colors, borders, shadows, spacing, typography
- Use ONLY the new design system patterns and components
- Do NOT mix styles from different design systems

This is a COMPLETE REDESIGN, not just modifications.
