Based on the following design JSON, generate a single, self-contained HTML block to visually represent this design.
- Use inline CSS for styling.
- Use flexbox or grid for layouts.
- The output must be ONLY the HTML code, without any explanation, comments, or markdown like \`\`\`html. Just provide the raw HTML.
- Make it as visually accurate as possible, but keep it simple. This is for a small preview inside a chat bubble.
- Ensure text is readable and elements are reasonably spaced.
